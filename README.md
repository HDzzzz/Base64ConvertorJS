# Base64ConvertorJS
This is a very simple website that allows you to "encode" or "decode" base64 strings , as you can see there in the JS script you can choose to enable or disable "alerts" and this is related to the "Clipboard" if clipboard is enabled once a string has been encoded or decoded it will store the variable onto the users clipboard , Showing an alert is optional as it can be quite annoying so it can be disabled if needed.
